# Colored Tags Plugin for Obsidian

![demo](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-colored-tags/assets/584632/6ea9920a-b68b-4658-8533-9e7e2aa3dbba)


Colorizes tags in different colors. The color depends on the tag content. Colors of nested tags are mixed with parent tags.
Text color contrast is automatically matched to comply with AA level of WCAG 2.1.
The colors are adjusted for the dark theme as well.

## Roadmap
- [x] ~~Settings for palette size, base chroma, and base lightness.~~
- [x] ~~Optimization: store existing, already calculated colors of tags. Render only new ones.~~
- [x] ~~Optimization: append styles instead of replacing each time.~~
- [ ] Change color assignments to predictable cycle from one color to another (breaking change).
